      Everyone's been there. You and your friends find a magical pair of pants, on the last summer before college. That might be a book. Anyway, you all want these pants, to work them, show off how fantastic they make you look. What if the pants were a piece of code? Maybe a fashion app? You all love it, want to work, but unlike pants, you can all work on it at once! How does <i>this</i> magic work? Version control! It's this magical ability to have a central file, and everyone can control their own version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
       <br/>Well, say you're writing code for a pants design app. Becky can write the section on bedazzling and merge it with the larger files. At the same time, Paula can present her code regarding plotting pleats in pants. The real benefit is allowing everyone to create versions separately, on their own local machines, and merge them into one document.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
       <br/>Now, git is your new coding best friend when it comes to version control. It keeps track of the changes you've made. If a file is changed, saved again, new folders made, it keeps track. Anytime you are in your repository [The place where you store your code], you can check your git status by typing just that. You know quickly what changes have been made. Then you just type git add and tell them which file you are ready to commit [which means to make it the master copy as it were], and commit them each.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
       <br/>GitHub is really well structured to work alongside your git. It also allows for cross-Internet collaboration. As well, GitHub enables others to view your code, offer suggestions and to allow you to see others work and use them to improve or assist your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>That's why we do this!</b>
        <br/>Dev Bootcamp is an environment where everyone wants everyone to succeed. Using version control, git and GitHub to enchance our communication and our community is just one step in creating greatness!

  <h1>Week 1 (Version Control/git/GitHub)</h1>
  <h2>An intro to the importance of Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h2>
  <h4>November 16, 2015</h4>

    <p>
     Hi there! My name is Kevin Huang. I'm a part of the Squirrels cohort at Dev Bootcamp. In this blog, you will find out about my weekly adventures with Dev Bootcamp and the topics that are being taught! For this blog post I will be introducing you to version control, git and Github - all very important things. Without further ado, let's dive in!
    </p>
    <p>
        First, let's find out what version control is. Version control allows you to track changes that happen to your files and review why, when, and how they happened. This is very important in development because if a random glitch were to be added into code that you wrote, you would want to know why, when, and how that happened. Version control software does all of that for you automatically!
    </p>
    <p>
       Now that we know what version control is, we can dive into version control software, specifically git! Git is a popular version control software that makes it easy for developers to work collaboratively while tracking ANY changes made to their code. With git, developers working together across the world can ensure that they are all working with the exact same file simultaneously. Even if they make changes to that same file, git allows those developers to precisely merge their changes so that all of the work can be unified. Without git doing this for them, developers might accidentally overwrite code that another developer's work. Git is installed locally on your computer and helps you track changes to your code by keeping a log of actions. Any number of actions performed in git can be reversed, so if any mistakes are made, don't worry - you can always undo changes that are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let's find out what GitHub is and why it matters. GitHub is a service that allows your to host and share code on their remote servers, which use git for version control. Because GitHub hosts your folders using git, it's easy to share code and work collaboratively with other developers using its services. GitHub works remotely and automatically tracks any changes with git. GitHub is important because it acts as a social network for development by making it easy to share and work on code in collaboratively on the Internet.
