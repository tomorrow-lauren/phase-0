You want to create a repository? If you are on your GitHub profile, select the repositories tab, and click the green "New" button. Fill out all the information on the next page and hit Create repository. Complete. Now on the right side of the page of your new repository, there is a spot for the "HTTPS clone URL". If you hit the tiny clipboard icon, it will copy the link for you. Now, open terminal. Assuming that you are in the folder you want to place your repository [if not, use "cd [folder you want to place it in]" to navigate there], type "git clone [YOUR COPIED URL]". Now the repository is on your local machine as well.

Open source software is software where the source code is available for adaptation and use.

I think Open Source is definitely a step in the right direction. I think that having clear, concise copyright licenses will go a long way to freeing us from these ridiculous copyright/estate cases. I mean, a 90 year exclusive copyright is ridiculous. This is also such a far distance from where copyright law started.

Licenses are important because it gives you specific control of the properties and uses of said properties of your material. I think that by allowing the producer of content to be actual specific master of their copyright, it gives more freedom to the coding environment, and encourages the sense of community.

I really think I'm starting to get the hang of pushing things to GitHub. A few more practices and I might actually have some confidence.

I didn't find any resources on this particular subject, but I sugggest that if you are interested in copyright in other forms as well, check out Creative Commons licenses.
