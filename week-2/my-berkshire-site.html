<!--
- It was pretty easy. Especially pairing, because I got to type without trying to remember words at the same time. It felt pretty good, using my rusty skills.
- It was good. I felt my partner and I learned a lot. w3 schools helped us find the trademark and copyright symbols.
- It wasn't hard with this site - I felt like it was mostly typing into a preset frame, so I set aside the design urges.
- The good is that it's pretty straight forward. The bad is that that means that the prettier parts are better handled in other forms, like CCS or JScript or whatever. HTML is good at laying the foundation.
- I always think that everything in HTML is the circle of life - every opening [tag] has a closing [tag]. I also remember if there's no closing tag, to put the /> at the end because that's what codecademy taught me.
