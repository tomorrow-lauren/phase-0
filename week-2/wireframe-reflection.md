1. What is a wireframe?
  + A wireframe is basically a layout of your website. Usually it is something the designer can layover the design and function to create the website with relative ease.
2. What are the benefits of wireframing?
  + It gives you an idea of what is going to go where. It also allows the designer to have an idea of what you want in terms of content.
3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  + Once I actually got the wireframe site to actually work, it was pretty breezy and fun.
4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  + both? the top was revised a couple times, but the blog part was simply added off the original site design.
5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  + I didn't really have any questions. I've done wireframing before, so I guess my resource was my experience. I've also been rereading Evil By Design. It's a hilarious but accurate book about UI & Design.
6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  + I found trying a couple other sites tedious - I ended up using MockFlow and it was so intuitive, I'm considering subscribing. Plus using the Bob Ross Lorem Ipsum generator was delightful. The tedious part was trying like. Lovely Chart and a couple others that didn't really work out.
