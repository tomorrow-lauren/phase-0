## Reflection Section
* What is a one-to-one database?
  * One to one databases are where you have 2 sets of info that only connect in one way - states only have one capital. In the example image I created, I illustrated the common concept of soulmates. There is only one corresponding soulmate per person. However each person is a unique individual with their own data.
* When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
  * Generally it's good for things like state capitals or recording things that generally come in pairs, or are intentionally unique in the pairing. Shoes and their closet. Social security numbers are only assigned to one person ever and the number will only ever pull up one person. Work assigned aliases are the same.
* What is a many-to-many database?
  * Many to many database is one where each table has an item that corresponds to another item on another table multiple times. They use a joining table to illustrate. Such as: the school has many student id's. The police station has many juvenile deliquents. If you make a joining table/database with student id's and juvenile arrest records, you can keep track of which students have arrest records.
* When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
  * Grocery lists is a great example. Student challenges, or even recording family units. A complex family tree, considering the amount of incest that went on in the olden times, might benefit from being recorded in such a way. The Lannisters send their information to this database.
* What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
  * I think I get confused about depth in terms of how these are visualized. I see, you know, student_id and I think that's ONLY ONE KID EVER but it's not that's jus trying to illustrate HOW the database is structured. I think using these makes sense when there is a LOT of information. I also think my mother, who is a librarian, is a genius. She navigates databases like a WIZARD.
