# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
---
For this release I read up on a couple of methods, Time Boxing, how to focus, growth learning and how to change my habits. I've already ordered a copy of "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg from my local library. Super excited to read that. I hope he's as interesting a writer as he is speaker. One other thing I mentioned was "Time-Boxing", which is segmenting out your work. put everything into little boxes, like 25 study, 10 min of play. I think this would be very helpful in Phase 0, scheduling the work time around all the other time. It would also help make sure I don't get too suck in anything - especially my own head. As far as "How do you manage your time currently?" I don't. I just get sort of overwhelmed with it all, procrastinate and then fly by the seat of my pants. This isn't working for me, in terms of stress. In terms of doing stuff, I'm usually clever enough to think my way out of most corners. The problem is relying on that cleverness when more work is needed. As far using those, I think I will try to be clever and creative, I just want to also implement a lot of the things I learned about. I am going to try and practice more, to make coding as habitual as chocolate or exercise. I think the "Learn Ruby The Hard Way" will be great for that. I also want to make sure that I use the Time-Boxing method in order to make sure I do get that relaxation. Weirdly enough, I just started Time-Boxing my weight loss goals before I even started these readings. I just didn't know it was time-boxing. I also want to use the knowledge of growth mindset to build myself up, to use my failures to educate myself and not to tear myself down. My current Time Boxing projection is getting 2 hours a day done on here - coding, projects, etc. Saturdays and Sundays will be more like 4-5 hours each, because I have more time on the weekend.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
---
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
⋅⋅* Shell and bash are processors/interfaces that allow us access to the power of the computer with a simple interface to better program with. In some cases, like the Mac OSX terminal, the shell "runs bash", essentially making them the same. Bash is a superset, a refined method of shell.
2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
⋅⋅* I found the video host utterly intolerable. I've listened/watched many of the videos from this course and outside this course and I don't know if it's because he spoke slowly and started off making me feel condescended to, like I don't know Unix [like I haven't used DOS/terminal before]. Anyway, he struck a nerve. Everything else was pretty straight forward.
3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
⋅⋅* Yes. I don't have many files to list or browse but I understand it. I wrote a bunch of them out too. It helps me learn.
4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
⋅⋅* mkdir and cd and ../ because organization is good for efficient and organized files and therefore code. plus i like giving things no one else will see funny names

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd print working directory

-ls list directory

-mv move [file/directory]

-cd change directory

-../ move up in the directory

-touch creates file

-mkdir make directory

-less page through the file

-rmdir remove directory

-rm remove [file/directory]

-help pulls up a list of commands

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
---
I found these instructions very straightforward and helpful. I think the only thing I would change is that the SSH lines didn't work, so I'd recommend showing HTTPS specifically. Forking a directory is useful because it creates a quick copy of other code so that you can edit or use it in your code quickly without having to rewrite the directories. I didn't really find any difficultly setting this up, because I've worked with git and GitHub before this assignment. However, I'd never forked or cloned anything, and I appreciate the knowledge of how to do that. I believe going forward, knowing how to quickly and efficiently clone and fork directories will be incredibly useful.
